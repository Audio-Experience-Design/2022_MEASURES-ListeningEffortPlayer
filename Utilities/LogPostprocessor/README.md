The log_postprocessor.py script is a prototype to support automatic transcription of audio recordings logged by the Listening Effort Player app. It uses Python bindings to the Whispercpp model, a CPU-based version of Open AI's open-source Whisper model.

## Installation

It requires Python 3.10.

Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Then run `python log_postprocessor.py` to see instructions on the command line arguments.
